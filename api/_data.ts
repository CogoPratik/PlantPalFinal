        content: "**Watering is crucial, but overwatering is the #1 killer of houseplants.**\n\nMost people think more water is better, but plant roots need oxygen too. When soil is constantly soggy, roots can't breathe and they begin to rot.\n\nThe best rule of thumb is to check the soil. Stick your finger about an inch or two into the soil. If it feels dry, it's time to water. If it's still moist, wait a few more days."

But not all light is created equal.\n\n*   **Bright, direct light:** At least 4-6 hours of direct sun. Great for cacti and succulents.\n*   **Bright, indirect light:** A bright spot where the sun's rays don't directly hit the leaves. Most tropical houseplants love this.\n*   **Medium light:** A spot that gets indirect light for part of the day, but is further from a window.\n*   **Low light:** A room with no direct sun, like a north-facing window. Best for plants like the Snake Plant or ZZ Plant."
